#TEAMROLE-4 people two will organised database admistrators will come up with oganising data clients and arrangements of it and other two will do backend developer of the project 
#TECHNOLOGY STACK-4  postgresSQL will allow and store,organise and manage data from its robust and reliable system like web,mobile,graphQL will query language and server-side run forclient request data and Django is high level python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean 
#Database Design-users can access and retrieve data from the database administrator application programmers,end-user and potentially system analysts and properties key database design properties data integrity this ensures the accuracy and consistency of data
#Feature-Breakdown-identifying and categorizing various aspects of user management fuctionalities including user account creation and property management system offer wide range like maintenance request and communication.booking system should offer a user-friendly interface,real-time avalibility,secure payment options and currency

#CI/CD PIPELINE-Is a series of automate steps that streamline the software development process from code creation to deployment tools which we can used for this project are jenkins and one can open source automation server and used that and one can circle CI which is integrate with various version control system and one can use GITHUB service which offer a simple and efficient way to automate work and one of them can open GitLab which will offer feature like pipeline definitions run and intergrate with the gitlab repository
